"# Confiscate"

## Overview

Confiscate is an audio streaming application that was initially designed to connect to Spotify's API. It offers features like getting access token, search, artist pages, interface. However, it currently lacks the essential playback functionality due to limitations in the Spotify API.

## Current Status

As it stands, Confiscate serves as a fully functional front-end application with the ability to explore artist pages and display track information from Spotify. It successfully obtains access token, but the playback feature remains unimplemented due to the restrictions of the Spotify API.

## Future Plans

To address the limitations posed by the Spotify API, I'm planning to transfer the application to integrate with the Soundcloud API. This will enable app to provide audio playback capabilities, allowing users to use Confiscate as intended.

## How to Use

For now, you can still use Confiscate to explore artist pages and view track information from Spotify. To begin using the playback feature, stay tuned for updates as we transition to the Soundcloud API.

## Getting Started

To get started with Confiscate, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository.
2. Configure your Spotify API credentials.
3. Install the necessary dependencies.
4. Run the application.

Detailed setup instructions and documentation will be provided as we continue to develop and expand the application.
